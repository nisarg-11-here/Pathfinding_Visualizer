Hello!

This Python project is a pathfinding visualizer that helps users visualize different paths considered using various algorithms. 
It helps you understand how different algorithms approach from start to endpoints while ignoring the barriers. 

The different algorithms that I have incorporated in the project are A* (A star) using Manhatten distance, Euclidean distance, CIV distance, Dijkstra, Depth First Search, and Breadth first search. 

**How to run the project:**

* Clone the Project
* Open it in a Python IDE (or interpreter)
* Run the **Pathfinding_Visualizer.py** file
* Once running, A screen should pop up.

**How to use the Visualizer?**

* Select any spot on the screen by using left click (Start point) - ORANGE
* Then select another spot on the screen (Endpoint) - TARQUIOUS
* OPTIONAL: Now you can make barriers between your start and endpoints - BLACK
* You can also remove any spots using a right click and replace the start and end points or barriers.
* Once done, to run the visualizer, you can click any of the given commands for different algorithms:
    * a - A star with CIV distance
    * e - A star with Euclidean distance
    * m - A star with Manhatten distance
    * b - breadth-first search
    * d - Dijkstra
    * f - Depth-first search
    * c - clear screen

Have a good day :)
